   Negative values simply scroll in the other direction. Defaults to: (1.0f, 1.0f).

   The parallaxFactor determines how much slower than the default (1.0f) the layer scrolls. At 0.0f the layer won't move at all. Design your layers so that the fastest
   moving layer has a parallaxFactor of 1.0f. To create a parallax scroller where your game layer has slower background layers and faster foreground layers, give
   the front-most foreground layer a parallaxFactor of 1.0f, your game's main layer perhaps 0.5f and the remaining layers values greater or smaller than 0.5f.

   Note: Yes, it makes it a little bit more difficult to tweak the speed based on the game's main layer in such a situation. It does however make things a lot simpler
   internally. In this case I decided the tradeoff in usability is acceptable, the tradeoff in additional code (special case handling) isn't. TILED-EDITABLE
