DEVELOPER_FIXME("Tilemap iPad scale factor still needed with Sprite Kit?")

/** @name Scaling */

/** By how much to scale the tilemap if the app is running on an iPad device. Defaults to 1.0f (no scaling, ie iPad displays larger portion of the map). Recommended value: 2.0f.

   Caution: Some combination of values and scale factor may cause inaccuracies, and possibly visual glitches. For example a scale factor of 1.5 and a odd-numbered tile size of 25x25 would
   make the upscaled tilesize 37.5x37.5 - but tile sizes should remain integer values this will affect tile positions and subsequently may introduce issues (this has not been tested, and
   is not recommended - tile sizes really should remain integer values).

   Notes on what this does and what is required to make it work:

   - The -ipad and -ipadhd tileset image's width & height must be scaled accordingly. For example by factor of 2.0f for a scaleFactor of 2.0f.
   - Tileset images' spacing and margin properties must also be scaled accordingly *if* scaleTilesetSpacingAndMargin is set to YES. See its description for when to use it.

/** If set to YES, will also scale each tileset's spacing & margin properties. This can be used if you simply upscale an iPhone tileset with an image program,
   which will also increase any existing spacing & margin accordingly. If you use a texture atlas program, it usually generates the same spacing and margin for all texture
   atlas files regardless of the contained image's scale factor. Defaults to NO (ie for use with a texture atlas program). Can be ignored for texture atlases which have
   neither spacing between tiles nor margin between outermost tiles and texture border.
