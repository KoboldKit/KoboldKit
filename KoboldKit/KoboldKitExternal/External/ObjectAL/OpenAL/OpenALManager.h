 * Manager class for OpenAL objects (ObjectAL).
 * Keeps track of devices that have been opened, and allows high level OpenAL management. 
 * Provides methods for loading ALBuffer objects from audio files. 
 * The OpenAL 1.1 specification is available at
 * http://connect.creativelabs.com/openal/Documentation 
 * Be sure to read through it (especially the part about distance models) as ObjectAL follows the
 * OpenAL object model. 
 *
 * Alternatively, you may opt to use OALSimpleAudio for a simpler interface.
