/**
 * Provides two controls (interrupted and manuallySuspended) for suspending
 * a slave object, and also propagates such control messages to interested
 * listeners.
 *
 * "interrupted" is meant to be set by the system when an interrupt occurs. 
 *
 * "manuallySuspended" is a user-settable control for suspending an object. 
 * "manuallySuspended" also has an extra step in its processing: When set,
 * the handler makes a note of what its listeners' "manuallySuspended" values are.
 * When cleared, it will only clear a listener's "manuallySuspended" value if it
 * was not set at suspend time. This allows for ad-hoc setting/clearing of
 * "manuallySuspended" in the middle of a handler/listener graph rather than
 * only from the top level. 
 *
 * When either control is set, the slave object will be suspended.  When both are
 * cleared, the slave object will be unsuspended.
