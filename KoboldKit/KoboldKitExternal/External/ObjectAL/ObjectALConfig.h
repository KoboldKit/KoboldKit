/** Resets the audio session when an error occurs that may have been caused by
 * a messed up session.
 *
 * In iOS 4.2, there are situations where an underlying sound system such as
 * mediaserverd will crash, putting the audio session in an uncertain state.
 * If this switch is enabled, OALAudioSession will reset itself when certain
 * kinds of audio errors occur.
 *
 * Recommended setting: 1 for release, possibly 0 during development.

/** Enables support for methods that take blocks as arguments.
 * Blocks are only supported in iOS 4.0+, so enabling this will make your project
 * incompatible with earlier operating systems (a 3.x system will crash the moment it
 * encounters a class that supports blocks).
 *
 * Recommended setting: 0 if you want to support iOS prior to 4.0, 1 if you don't care.

/** Determines how ObjectAL's actions are implemented.
 * If this is set to 1, ObjectAL's actions will inherit from cocos2d CCIntervalAction,
 * and will use cocos2d's CCActionManager rather than OALActionManager.

/** Sets the interval in seconds between steps when performing actions with OALAction
 * subclasses. Lower values offer better accuracy, but take up more processing time
 * because they fire more often. 
 *
 * Generally, you want at least 4-5 steps in an audio operation, so for durations
 * of 0.2 and above, an interval of 1/30 is fine.  For anything lower, you'll want a
 * smaller interval. 
 *
 * Note: The NSTimer documentation states that a timer will typically have a resolution
 * of around 0.05 to 0.1, though in practice smaller values seem to work fine. 
 *
 * Note: This setting only has effect if OBJECTAL_CFG_USE_COCOS2D_ACTIONS is 0.

 * access the same part of the audio library at the same time.
